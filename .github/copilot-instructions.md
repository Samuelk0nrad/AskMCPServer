## Ask tool

Use the Ask tool only for implementation decisions and technical choices.

### Use for:
- Confirming implementation approaches
- Choosing between technical alternatives
- Clarifying ambiguous requirements affecting code

### Don't use for:
- Meta-questions about explanations or response format
- Questions about your role or how to respond

### Examples:
✅ Good: "Should I use approach A or B for this feature?"
❌ Bad: "Should I explain how this code works?"

Always get clear direction on implementation details before writing code.
