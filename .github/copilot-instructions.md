## Ask tool

Always prioritize using the Ask tool to get the answer to a question.  
Use the Ask tool for clarification, confirmation, or additional context whenever possible.  
If there is any uncertainty about the user's intent or the answer, 
or if there are multiple possible ways to interpret or implement something, always use the Ask tool to seek clarification.  
Never make decisions independently; rely on the Ask tool to resolve ambiguities and provide a possible answer.
