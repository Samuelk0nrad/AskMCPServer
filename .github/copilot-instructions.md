## Ask tool - REQUIRED FOR ALL DECISIONS

Always use the Ask tool before making any implementation decisions or technical choices. Do not proceed with code implementation until you've received explicit direction.

### MANDATORY Use Cases:
- ALL implementation approaches (never choose on your own)
- ALL technical alternatives (never select without asking)
- ALL requirement clarifications (never assume)
- ANY decision that affects code structure or functionality
- BEFORE suggesting specific libraries, frameworks, or tools
- BEFORE deciding on naming conventions, patterns, or architecture

### Don't use for:
- Meta-questions about explanations or response format
- Questions about your role or how to respond

### Examples:
✅ Required: "Should I use approach A or B for this feature?"
✅ Required: "What naming convention should I use for this variable?"
✅ Required: "Should I implement this as a class or function?"
❌ Bad: "Should I explain how this code works?"

### Process:
1. When asked to implement anything, FIRST identify ALL decisions needed
2. Use the Ask tool for EACH decision point
3. Only proceed with implementation after receiving clear direction
4. If unsure about ANY aspect, use the Ask tool before proceeding

Remember: You are NOT authorized to make implementation decisions without using the Ask tool.
